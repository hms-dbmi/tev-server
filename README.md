# TEV(Tumor Evolution Visualization)-server

## Motivation
The primary visualizations used to discuss and reconstruct tumor evolution are [fishplots](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v481/n7382/fig_tab/nature10738_F2.html). Although they're very simplistic, they can take geneticists and physicians alike a substantial amount of time to create in visual editors. To combat this issue we developed a simple drag and drop fishplot editor, along with several accompanying visualizations to help determine variant characteristics and relationships, to generate these plots within minutes. Recently, an [R package](https://github.com/chrisamiller/fishplot) has been developed to generate publication quality fishplots. However, this tool is limited to users that have R programming experience and have access to cancer cell fraction (CCF) information about their samples.
